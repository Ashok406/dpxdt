Backend
- Split site-diff to use server-side capture queue, so it can be much faster in aggregate
- Add build URLs to releases
- Add fetched URLs to runs so you can click through to visit
- Capture 500 errors automatically retried up to N times.

Frontend
- Create a sitediff crud; have config section for CSS to inject (to hide tweet buttons with changing counts, etc), prefixes to ignore, email address to notify
- Compare mode; use hot-keys to quickly scroll through images

Everywhere
- Auth, owners, modification logs
- Cache DB queries

Future
- Redirect uploads to go directly to S3 with a 307
- Account sign-up
- Email or HTTP callback once processing / reviewing state hit for a release
- OAuth flow for robots
- All screenshots deleted after 3 days unless you're in pro mode

-------

What is needed for each capture run:

- build name
- release name
- common code to define across all tests
  - can be remote resources?
- list of:
  - test name
  - host-prefix A
  - host-prefix B
  - relative URL to test
  - Code to run on both
  - username/password using HTTP basic auth
  - header key/value pairs
  - css selectors to hide
  - screen size (for responsive CSS)
  - User agent spoofing (can just do this with headers?)


-------

Random thoughts

- It'd be cool if you could register your own workers to operate on your own capturing needs, which would make it possible to use a centralized trusted server for hosting diffs but then a separate worker pool on an internal network for doing the rendering.

- Would be nice if the background servers self-registered themselves
