Frontend
- Homepage
- Homepage shows the user all of the builds they have
- Branding, footer on all pages
- Allow user to set build to good/bad when in processing state
- Add before/after/diff button on artifact page
- Add next/prev run to artifact page
- Add approve/disapprove run to artifact page
- Always allow localhost worker to talk to localhost so local testing isn't annoying
- Diff says "None found" on comparison page when processing is pending
- Fix the favicon URL

-------

Future
- Let other users be owners of the same build ID
- Add button to make build public
- Free/test apps always have public assets
- Add ToS click-through in login middleware
- Cache DB queries
- Capture diff fetch 500 errors automatically retried up to N times.
- Log diff approvals and any other release state changes
- use hot-keys to quickly scroll through images
- Redirect uploads to go directly to S3 with a 307
- Email or HTTP callback once processing / reviewing state hit for a release
- All screenshots deleted after 3 days unless you're in pro mode
- Create a sitediff crud; have config section for CSS to inject (to hide tweet buttons with changing counts, etc), prefixes to ignore, email address to notify
- Split site-diff to use server-side capture queue, so it can be much faster in aggregate
- Would be nice if the background servers self-registered themselves

-------

What is needed for each capture run:

- build name
- release name
- common code to define across all tests
  - can be remote resources?
- list of:
  - test name
  - host-prefix A
  - host-prefix B
  - relative URL to test
  - Code to run on both
  - username/password using HTTP basic auth
  - header key/value pairs
  - css selectors to hide
  - screen size (for responsive CSS)
  - User agent spoofing (can just do this with headers?)

Testing locally

./run_site_diff.sh \
  --upload_build_id=2 \
  --upload_release_name='blue' \
